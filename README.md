## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ajith Nair and I'm a Data Science graduate from UC Santa Barbara with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. Currently, I'm diving deeper into Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to expand my expertise in cutting-edge technologies. My technical toolkit includes Python, R, PyTorch, SQL, AWS, and more, with experience in machine learning projects, data analysis, and game development. I'm always looking to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of data science and AI. Let's build something amazing!
